**Do I need to send any documentation proving my student status?**

No, because we trust you :-)

You don’t need to send or upload any documentation during the registration and payment process, but the organizer may ask for your student card when picking up the badge during on-site check-in.
I need to verify the VAT information of the ACPySS. Where can I find the address and VAT-ID?

Please check our contacts page: http://pyss17.pyss.org/contacts.html

**I'm buying business tickets and I think I don't have to pay the 10% VAT.**

We're sorry but European regulations (as well as our tax advisor) say that every European company must pay VAT for services or goods that will be consumed in other countries. In Python San Sebastian tickets we have included two VAT taxes: cultural event and catering, which coincidentally are the same: 10%. Hence we must charge this 10% VAT on all tickets, including the business tickets. However every company can obtain the VAT in return:
Companies from the European Union

The companies from the European Union can request their Spanish VAT back through their own country's Tax Office.
Companies from Outside the European Union

Non EU-companies will have more trouble doing this. They must:

- First of all, name a legal representative stablished in Spain (tax/legal advisor).

- This representative must request for a return of the VAT to the Agencia Tributaria Estatal (Spanish Tax Office) presenting a paper form, el modelo 361 (an example here). The instructions to fill it are here. This request must be done through internet and a Digital Certificate from the Agencia Tributaria Estatal is needed.

**I bought my ticket early, but I cannot attend. What can I do?**

You can send an email to info@pyss.org and let us know. We will fully refund your ticket costs except the administrative (bank, online payments services, etc) costs until September 10th.

**Refund requests must be issued before September 10th**. Please understand that we cannot process refund requests after that date, since we have a lean budget to run.

**I helped organize the Python San Sebastian 2017 conference. Do you have special rates for volunteers?**

For volunteers who have invested a significant amount of time into organizing the conference or helping out on site during the conference, we will issue refunds for their tickets.

The refund amount depends on the amount of work done.

**I've bought more than one ticket and now I want to assign it to a friend but the website does not allow me. How should I proceed?**

Please wait. Your friends will definitely get their tickets. We are really sorry for that and we are working as fast as possible to get it solved.

Talks and Trainings
-------------------

**I would like to present an interesting topic. Which formats do you have available ?**

We will have standard conference talks (duration: TBD), trainings (duration: TBD) and poster sessions.

**How can I give a talk at Python San Sebastian?**

We will issue a Call for Proposals (CFP) when we’re ready to receive talk submissions.

Once the CFP is open, you can propose your talk by logging in to the website and going to the CFP section.

Talks will then be voted on by the attendees. A subset will also be selected by the program workgroup members to also give less mainstream topics a chance and to enhance the speaker diversity, if needed (we hope not).

**Will I get a discount if I get selected as speaker?**

No, ACPySS is a non-profit society and because of our low rates we can afford giving discounts to speakers.

**Must I sign the video recording and publishing agreement?**

Python San Sebastian conference is not recorded. To simplify the organization, we ask all speakers and trainers to accept the video recording and publishing of their session. Just in case.
