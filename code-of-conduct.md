##  Code Of Conduct 

Python San Sebastian (PySS) aims to be a welcoming event, where people meet in a friendly environment. Accordingly, we expect that all participants show respect and courtesy to other participants throughout the conference.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any PySS event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code before and throughout the event.

## In short

* PySS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
* We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
* Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.
* Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Don't publish photographs of people without their consent. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for PySS.
* Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.
* The acronym for this conference (PySS) is as natural to us as any other event in San Sebastián, where we just add the 'SS' city acronym. We are sorry if it results disturbing for you, it comes naturally, it's not our fault.

## Longer version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for PySS.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.

## Reporting harassment

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately (conference staff can be identified by the light green t-shirt) or call one of your staff members dealing explicitly with Code-of-Conduct issues:

* **+34 630 555 357** (male staff member)
* **+34 676 344 941** (female staff member)

If you're currently afraid of your physical safety or are in danger, contact local law enforcement:

* Emergency (Fire, Medical, Police): 112

It may be required to speak Spanish (or Basque) while talking to Local law enforcement officers. If needed, ask somebody speaking Spanish (or Basque) to make the call for you.

### How to report the harassment incident?

Report the harassment incident (preferably in writing) to a conference staff member – all reports are confidential. When reporting the event to staff, try to gather as much information as available, but do not interview people about the incident – Staff will assist you in writing the report/collecting information.

The important information consists of:

* Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant doing the harassing
* The behaviour that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behaviour (if different than the time the report was made)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Other people involved in the incident

The staff is well informed on how to deal with the incident and how to further proceed with the situation. Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
